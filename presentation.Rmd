# Background/Motivation
---

# Rationale and Aim

- Mixed effects (or multilevel) models are extensions of linear models (regressions)
- Commonly used in experimental and observational research and policy and evaluation contexts
- Are less widely-used by data scientists
- One piece of evidence: Cross Validated has 1,392 questions tagged #mixed-model that are unanswere (of 3,337 total questions)
- I am trying to introduce mixed effects model as a data science(-*ish*) statistical method that can be useful and is easy to estimate and interpret.
