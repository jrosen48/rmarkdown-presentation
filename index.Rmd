# Motivation

## Expectancy-value theory

We choose things that we are *confident* that we can do well and that are *valuable* to us

We do these in a sociocultural *context*: our sense of belonging impacts what we choose to do

## An argument about RMarkdown

- This presentation will make the argument that **you can use RMarkdown to solve
problems that are important to you**
- In doing so, you can **participate in a cool community of data scientists in education!**

## Timing

- Second 20 minutes: You working through an R Markdown document (in RStudio Cloud) (to build *confidence*)
