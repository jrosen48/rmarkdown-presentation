# Motivation

## Expectancy-value theory

We choose things that we are *confident* that we can do well and that are *valuable* to us

We do these in a sociocultural *context*: our sense of belonging impacts what we choose to do

## An argument about RMarkdown

- This presentation will make the argument that **you can use RMarkdown to solve
problems that are important to you**

- In doing so, you can **participate in a cool community of data scientists in education!**

---

# Structure

## Timing

- First 20 minutes: Introduction (to establish *value*)

- Second 20 minutes: You working through an R Markdown document (in RStudio Cloud) (to build *confidence*)

- Final 20 minutes: Discussion

---

# Introduction

## How we write papers and reports

- With **Google Docs** (or Microsoft Word) to write *text*
- With **Excel/SPSS/Dedoose/datavyu** (or other statistics/qualitative data analysis software) to *analyze data and produce output*

- We copy-paste or enter values from the software we use into a Google Doc

- Some issues that emerge:

  - Takes time
   
  - Must be careful
  
  - Requires updating when the analysis (or sample) changes
  
  - Can be unwieldy due to the multiple files (and file types)
  
  - Reproducibility

# R Markdown

- R Markdown is a tool for literate programming

- Literate programming combines *text* with *code and its output*

- It can be used to produce documents with different formats:

  - PDF
  - Web-based (HTML)
  - Word

- Example: `analyze-form-responses.Rmd`

---

# Try it out!

- `analyze-form-responses-try-it-out.rmd`

---

# Discussion

For what else can you use R Markdown?

Computational tools can provide you with a new way of approaching your work:

- Project updates
- Dissertation/thesis
- Manuscripts
- Blog
- Book
